# Michael's Annoyances #
  * Replace controller metadata system with something else (OROCOS-based?)
  * Find a better way of connecting to different robots (with different numbers of legs or different systems) without recompiling
  * Have support for multiple top-level controllers each controlling one or more systems

# GUI #
  * Have a nice display for different e-stop codes
    * Support for this has been implemented in the new RT Ops
  * Replace caret with 3-d model (a-la-Gazebo?)

# General #
  * Allow some sort of "startup" and "shutdown" mode i.e. the ability to have "enable" trigger a free-standing robot to stand up, and for "disable" to gracefully crouch back down.
