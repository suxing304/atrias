## Install the jig ##

To align the IMU mount, first bolt this L-shaped epoxy jig:

to the inside of the robot, like this:

The jig helps align the mount along the robot's Y axis. Use flathead bolts to
ensure concentricity with the clearance holes.

At the DRL, the outside vertical surface of the chassis and the angle of the
boom were used as references for alignment along the X axis. We used a folded
piece of paper (white object in photo above) to tilt the mount away from the
inside surface.

Alignment along the Z axis was not considered beyond tightly pressing the mount
against the inside surface of the chassis. This was an oversight on our part.
A right angle should be used against the aluminum skeleton for Z alignment.


## Epoxy the IMU ##

With the epoxy applied to the flat side of the IMU mount, push it flat against
the jig and the body of the robot. The inside surface of the carbon fiber
chassis may not be vertical. Using a digital level, match the tilt (along the
X axis) of the mount with the outer vertical surface of the chassis, as shown.
