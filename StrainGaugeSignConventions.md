The strain gauges should be wired so that an external force applied to the toe, from the center of the boom outwards, causes <knee force 1> - <knee force 2> to be a positive value.

Rationale: This way a hip motor torque command that is too high results in a positive "knee force" (and vice-versa for the other direction).
