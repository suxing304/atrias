### From Kevin Galloway at Univ. Mich. ###

  1. We had some trouble with the black plastic strips which contain some of the wiring on the under side of the hips. (See attached pictures.) The black plastic strips started peeling off from the attachment points, and we ended up replacing a couple of them with some other plastic strips we had in the lab, glued on with Gorilla glue. That's held for a little while now, but still seems a bit flimsy. A possibly related issue is that one of the limit switches in that area had a wire come loose or get cut. Not sure if it got pinched when the plastic came loose, or if something else happened.

  1. One of the wires came loose on the e-stop next to the motor power switch. This is most likely because the velcro strips had come loose (i.e. the ones that hold the mounting face with the power switch and e-stop) and so any vibration would cause that plate to move a lot.

  1. Occasionally (and randomly) the right hip motor stops responding to commands, and the only "fix" seems to be cycling the power on the robot. Possibly an issue with the amplifier board.

  1. We had the issue with the scraping sound in one of the hip gears, but we followed the instructions you sent to fix that and we haven't had trouble since.
