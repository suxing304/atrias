# ATRIAS 2.1 Inertial Breakdown Quick Reference #

## Intent ##

The intent of this page is to provide a quick reference for the breakdown of moving components of ATRIAS 2.1 and list the simple inertial data for these sub-assemblies. The Mechanical Engineer in charge of the solidworks model of this robot has checked each sub-assembly and posted the pictures below to show the correct composition of each assembly and simple inertial info.

The pictures used in this page will be stored in the Git repository under "\documentation\Inertia Images\".

## Download ##

The solidworks files and images displayed below are available for download at the following link.

# Body #

The following 3 images show the entirety of the ATRIAS 2.1 Body. Add the weights and inertia's to get the total torso. I apologize for not having this together in solidworks as a whole. This was done as a quick solution to find the inertia matrix and center of mass of the Torso.
