_Be alert and pay very, very careful attention while assembling or modifying
any hardware concerning the IMU. Double check your assumptions regarding the
pinout out of the IMU, their color mapping, and how they map to the Menial
connectors. If you follow the pictures and tables below, you can't mess up._

Nominal current draw of Medulla and IMU at 12 V should be around 470 mA.

Nominal temperature after prolonged operation at room temperature sitting on an ESD mat is around 42 deg C.

## Datasheets, etc. ##
